Course learning outcomes:
1. Analyze and evaluate the properties of LTI systems in terms of its z-transforms.
2. Understand the sampling theorem and perform sampling on continuous-time signals.
3. Apply the concepts of all-pass and minimum-phase systems to analyze the LTI system and address
complex design problems.
4. Evaluate design problems related to frequency selective processing and design FIR/IIR filters.
5. Construct systems for spectral estimation of real signals.
